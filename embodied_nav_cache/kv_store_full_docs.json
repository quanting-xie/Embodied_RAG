    "content": "Relationship: The group consists of two objects located within a 3D environment. The first object is a drone (drone_2), positioned at coordinates (0.054, -8.754, -1.345), indicating it is slightly elevated in the negative z-axis, suggesting it may be hovering or just above ground level. The second object is a chair (chair_cafeCharcoalGrey10), located at coordinates (-2.827, -6.318, 0.241), which places it on the surface, higher than the drone in the z-axis. Overall, the drone is closer to the origin point while the chair is positioned further back in the negative x and y directions, both objects existing in the same 3D space but at different elevations. to The summary of the objects in the 3D environment is as follows:\n\n1. **Drone (drone_2)**: \n   - Position: X = 0.0542, Y = -8.7543, Z = -1.3447\n   - This drone is located slightly above the ground, positioned primarily along the negative Y-axis.\n\n2. **Chair (chair_cafeCharcoalGrey10)**: \n   - Position: X = -2.8272, Y = -6.3181, Z = 0.2410\n   - This chair is situated on the ground level, also toward the negative Y-axis but further back on the X-axis.\n\nThese two objects are both positioned in a similarly negative Y-space, but the drone is elevated and located closer to the origin, while the chair is further back in the negative X direction., Type: part_of,"
